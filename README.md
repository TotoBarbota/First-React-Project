## This is my journey on learning React.

For my first exercise I created a simple counter application that has "CounterButton" components the modify a "counter" value. 

I made use of props(parameters) and the "useState" hook. I also created custom CSS styling to differensiate the color of the button based on the value they would increment the counter
( green for positive, red for negative ).

### Here is how it looks:

The color of the button is dependand on the value you pass to the component. The Component then checks if the incrementValue is positive or negative and sets the buttonClass accordingly.

As you can see I also implemented a simple reset button to set the counter back to 0.
